# E-DAI_FinalProject
Final Project for E&amp;DAI module of Jönköping University.

## To make the project work:
1. Install Tensorflow using this tutorial: https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html?fbclid=IwAR3tp8BvZino36hJE9JZkE_Js-7RkFpbmGkPqpWEnYn61J_b6jjxGPrtSY0
2. Move the "models" folder to the place of the one in the newly installed folder.
3. Go to the folder models -> research -> object_detection
4. Run the "tensorboard.sh" script after you have changed the route to match the position of your "export" folder.

The script shows you the results of the AI training.
If you want to see the models, go to the "export" folder then "checkpoint".

All the scripts used to transform the basic project data into Tensorflow readable files are in the Github root folders.
